**Status**: 40% complete

---

### ❌ Didn't Get To

- [ ] Reading 10 thesis topic proposals in depth

**Reason**: Focused on infrastructure setup first. Will tackle these in Week 44.

---

### 🔥 Challenges & Blockers

None at this stage. Setup is progressing smoothly.

---

### 💡 Insights & Learning

- **Process insight**: Having a robust tracking system (timeline + milestones + weekly logs) from the start will prevent losing track later when things get hectic
- **Methodological learning**:
  - Mixed methods requires careful planning - need to decide if sequential (quant → qual) or convergent (parallel)
  - Metoda Gioia is standard for rigorous qualitative analysis in management research
  - Important to pre-test instruments before full deployment
- **Deadline awareness**: First official deadline is Nov 1 (3 topics) - only 10 days away! Need to accelerate tema refinement

---

### 👥 Meetings & Consultations

#### Meeting cu Coordinator
- **Date**: Not yet scheduled
- **Action item**:
  - [ ] Contact coordinator pentru first meeting (before Nov 1 deadline)
  - [ ] Prepare 3 refined topic proposals (1-2 pag each)

### 💭 Reflections

**What went well**:
- Excellent progress on infrastructure
- Comprehensive planning system in place
- Clear visibility on all deadlines and milestones
- Good momentum and excitement

**What could be improved**:
- Need to shift focus from setup to actual research content starting Week 44
- Should schedule coordinator meeting ASAP
- Need to accelerate literature search

**Lesson learned**:
- Investing time in setup (tracking systems, templates) pays off later
- Breaking down 8-month project into weekly chunks makes it less overwhelming
- Having 3 parallel tracks (all 3 themes) gives flexibility but requires discipline

**Self-care check**: ✅ Good balance so far. Remember to maintain this throughout the marathon ahead.
