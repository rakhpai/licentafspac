In the era of rapid technological advancement, AI offers innovative tools that redefine customer engagement, campaign effectiveness, and market competitiveness. Employing a qualitative case study approach, the research gathered data through interviews with marketing executives, employee questionnaires, and direct observation of AI-driven marketing operations in ten multinational companies. The findings reveal that AI significantly enhances campaign personalization and efficiency, with 70% of respondents noting improved product relevance and 80% citing better marketing budget optimization. Despite these benefits, companies face persistent challenges, particularly in integrating systems and preparing employees. Data privacy concerns and the need to strike a balance between automation and creativity also emerged as critical issues. This study concludes that AI, while transformative, requires careful strategic implementation to maximize its potential in global marketing contexts. The study’s implications include guidance on training needs, strategic alignment, and ethical compliance in the adoption of AI.","This study explores AI's strategic role in transforming digital marketing, revealing enhanced campaign personalization and efficiency, but also highlights challenges in integration, employee preparedness, data privacy, and striking a balance between automation and creativity."

Although earlier studies have examined how certain AI applications are utilized, there still exist limited broad, theory-informed syntheses across marketing domains. In mitigation of this, the present study performs a systematic literature review based on PRISMA 2020 standards. 753 Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect papers were screened, and 162 peer-reviewed published articles from 2018 to early 2025 were selected for final analysis. Through thematic mapping and grounded coding, the review proposes the AI-Augmented Marketing Framework (AAMF) and underscores five strategic domains wherein AI integration is taking place: personalized engagement, dynamic campaign automation, generative content planning, explainable AI systems, and ethical AI governance. Unlike prior reviews centered on automation and customer relationship management (CRM), this study situates AI as a dynamic capability to facilitate value co-creation, leveraging the Dynamic Capabilities Framework and Service-Dominant Logic. The evaluation also takes into account the twofold potential and risk of generative AI models such as ChatGPT, which facilitate amplifiable creativity while posing ethical and transparency issues. Key limitations include database and language restrictions, the dynamic evolution of AI, and publication bias. The current research contributes a conceptual framework, integrates fragmented literature, and proposes a future research agenda centred on AI-persona alignment, SME adoption, brand equity modelling, and cross-cultural personalization. It provides hands-on guidance on how to manage strategic, ethical, and imaginative aspects of AI in marketing.","This systematic review synthesizes 162 AI marketing studies, proposing the AI-Augmented Marketing Framework (AAMF) across five strategic domains, and highlights the dynamic capability of AI in value co-creation, while addressing ethical and transparency concerns."

Increased government scrutiny and focus on consumer protection have also created additional difficulty and competition for digital marketers. Simultaneously, innovations in machine learning and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) are driving new levels of operational efficiency, offering marketers transformative tools to enhance productivity. However, many organisations are not prepared to introduce this new technology and create a culture of testing and scaling AI technologies within the organisation. Adoption of advanced tools represents significant opportunities for digital marketers combined with challenges in a business environment bogged down by regulatory concerns, employee apprehension and rising operational costs. To navigate these tumultuous times successfully, digital marketers require a healthy blend of advanced technical knowledge and calculated risk-taking. By concentrating on the five ‘C’s of digital marketing (content, creative, campaigns, conversions and customer), marketers can identify the best instances for adopting GenAI into their process.

This exploratory study delves into how these agencies adapt to AI-driven technologies, employing the dynamic capabilities framework, particularly the concept of seizing capabilities. Drawing from 18 in-depth interviews with agency leaders and marketing experts conducted in 2024, the study seeks to understand how AI transforms industry practices. The findings reveal that agencies leverage AI to optimize processes and enhance efficiency. However, dynamic seizing capabilities are characterized by a predominantly decentralized and agile approach to knowledge absorption, decision-making, and implementation. Agencies frequently employ a trial-and-error methodology, driven by both top-down and bottom-up processes, reflecting the dynamic nature of this emerging media technology market.

Strategic partnerships, crucial for deeper AI integration, remain underutilized, including co-creative approaches with clients. Moreover, data protection and security concerns prominently influence AI adoption strategies, necessitating structured guidelines and regulations. Agencies recognize the potential for AI to reshape their value propositions, with the aim of transitioning back towards more creativity-focused and consultative. However, tangible shifts in business models have yet to be realized.

Despite the growing attention and financial commitment towards AI, there is a notable deficiency in existing research on the strategic planning and future adoption of AI-powered digital advertising in medium-sized retail Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to investigate the methods by which these organizations aim to incorporate AI into their digital advertising campaigns.

"Artificial Intelligence in Marketing","https://scispace.com/papers/artificial-intelligence-in-marketing-hv3e6mgefi","2018","","","James Cannella","","","Yes","","Artificial intelligence (AI) is a burgeoning technology, industry, and field of study. While interest levels regarding its applications in marketing have not yet translated into widespread adoption, AI holds tremendous potential for vastly altering how marketing is done. As such, AI in marketing is a crucial topic to research. By analyzing its current applications, its potential use cases in the near future, how to implement it and its areas for improvement, we can achieve a high-level understanding of AI’s long-term implications in marketing. AI offers an improvement to current marketing tactics, as well as entirely new ways of creating and distributing value to customers. For example, programmatic advertising and social media marketing can allow for a more comprehensive view of customer behavior, predictive analytics, and deeper insights through integration with AI. New marketing tools like biometrics, voice, and conversational user interfaces offer novel ways to add value for brands and consumers alike. These innovations all carry similar characteristics of hyper-personalization, efficient spending, scalable experiences, and deep insights. There are important issues that need to be addressed before AI is extensively implemented, including the potential for it to be used maliciously, its effects on job displacement, and the technology itself. The recent progression of AI in marketing is indicative that it will be adopted by a majority of companies soon. The long-term implications of vast implementation are crucial to consider, as an AI-powered industry entails fundamental changes to the skill-sets required to thrive, the way marketers and brands work, and consumer expectations.

Despite its relative infancy in the market, applications of AI already boast impressive efficacy across industries, particularly in marketing. Recent advancements in AI technology and growing numbers of use cases demonstrating its effectiveness have garnered excitement amongst marketers. This excitement has not fully translated into a universal understanding of how the technology works, its practical implementation, and the long-term implications it carries. As AI quickly becomes more sophisticated and widely adopted in marketing, the ability for marketers to effectively implement and manage it will become an ever more important skill. Likewise, individuals’ understanding of their role in creating and distributing value in an AI-powered workplace is pivotal to the success of their career, the companies they work for, and the consumers with whom they interact. It thus stands that AI may soon insinuate sweeping change to the nature of marketing itself. The “AI Marketing Era,"" as it may appropriately be labeled, entails fundamental changes to the manner in which marketers interact with customers, the tactics, and tools they use to achieve their goals, the skills they regard highly in the workplace, and the nature of their day-to-day responsibilities. Akin to the magnitude of change brought forth by the advent of computers, artificial intelligence carries the potential to change the nature of marketing drastically. It is for this reason that the topic of artificial intelligence in marketing requires in-depth research and analysis to prepare for changes to come. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MARKETING 6 The increasingly sophisticated advancements in AI technology paired with a disconnect between heightened levels of excitement among marketers and high-level implementation makes the topic of AI Marketing evermore crucial to research. As such, my thesis holds that despite issues at macro and micro levels in need of being addressed before its widespread adoption, artificial intelligence offers net-positive benefits to marketers, consumers, and society as a whole through its ability to improve the creation, optimization, and distribution of value. Scope and Methodology This paper analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence on marketing at micro and macro levels. Given the wide-ranging topic of AI and its many different applications, I have limited the scope of this paper to only its impact on marketing. The topic of AI in marketing itself may be vast enough to justify narrowing the scope of research down further into specific applications and use cases. However, my intentions for this paper were to address the issue in a manner that provides a natural entry point for marketers to begin learning about AI in their field, while providing enough detail for each application and use case to offer novel insights. AI in marketing is complex and quickly evolving. As such, my research faces limitations of the potential for promptly becoming outdated. Further, the vast array of potential applications of AI in marketing has limited me to only being able to focus on the topics I have found most relevant to the daily practice of marketers. AI applied to search (e.g., Google ranking algorithms, personalization of search results, etc.) is one topic that was intentionally left out due to time constraints in being able to research, synthesize, and provide a useful perspective of the subject. These limitations mean this paper is by no means an exhaustive analysis of AI in marketing. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MARKETING 7 The excitement surrounding AI in marketing presents a limitation relating to my research methodology. Advanced AI is still a new technology in marketing. As such, there is a lack of extensive peer-reviewed research on the topic. Many sources used to obtain data on issues such as perceptions and reporting of AI (e.g., its effectiveness in various scenarios, consumer perceptions it, etc.) may not have been collected in an entirely accurate manner. Similarly, biases stemming from the heightened enthusiasm about AI and opinions of it being a fix-all solution for all marketing problems may have potentially skewed research findings. Nonetheless, there is still a great deal of highly credible research sources available from recent years (2017 and 2018). A primary goal of my research methodology was to piece together an objective, nuanced understanding of AI in marketing. It may be easy to categorize AI marketing as unanimously beneficial based on the many case studies and white papers showcasing its positive effects. However, doing so limits the ability to see other potential long-term effects that may come as a result, and increases the likelihood of overspending on premature AI implementation and rushing into widespread AI adoption without a proactive plan to minimize its adverse effects. I have found it helpful to view the topic of AI in marketing with the understandings that 1.) AI is not a fix-all for every marketing problem, 2.) advanced iterations and increased adoption of AI can carry adverse implications and unintended consequences, and 3.) despite extreme levels of hype, the impact of AI in marketing is proving to be highly significant. My research methods for attempting to achieve a holistic perspective on AI Marketing was multifaceted but primarily focused on secondary research sources. Peer reviewed papers, large-scale studies from research firms, and reports from credible institutions provide empirical ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MARKETING 8 data. Presentations and academic lectures regarding AI offer a variety of different perspectives and a glimpse into current events at the forefront of the industry. Textbook literature and journal publishings provide an understanding of the technical aspects of the technology itself.

This paper examines the major effects and ethical concerns related to incorporating AI in online marketing strategies. Starting with a summary of AI’s development and its crucial position in present-day marketing, the research emphasizes its revolutionary functions such as making decisions based on data, providing customized user experiences, and automating processes. By developing AI algorithms, marketers can analyse bigger datasets, determine patterns, and predict trends, introducing the world into a new era of marketing innovation. A central focus of AI in online marketing is its ability to deliver highly personalized experiences to consumers, driven by the analysis of users’ behaviour, preferences and historical data. This personalized approach improves user engagement and drives conversion rates. AI also empowers marketers with real-time data processing and analysis, offering valuable insights into consumer behaviour, market trends, and campaign performance. Of course, besides its transformative potential, the integration of AI in online marketing presents significant ethical considerations. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic tendency, and transparency necessitate careful consideration to ensure responsible and ethical AI usage in marketing practices.

To deal with this volume and velocity of data, companies are beginning to employ artificial intelligence (AI) to help. As the pace of technology change and as the amount of available market and competitor data increases, marketers are faced with the dilemma of managing this data to understand the changing market and competitive landscape. This study explores potential antecedents and consequences of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption as a strategy to deal with this ever-increasing data. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and institutional theory, we examine four antecedents: technological opportunism, top management support, customer orientation, and normative pressure as potential influencers to AI adoption. AMOS SEM was employed to analyze responses from a survey of 225 marketing managers, product managers, and brand managers. Our results suggest top management support is critical to adoption of AI along with a culture focusing on customers. These forces seem to get the firm to desire AI to meet customer needs. In addition, firms will likely adopt AI in industries already adopting AI or in environments where governments or suppliers are pushing AI adoption. The pressure from these outside entities seem to make management sensitive to the need to keep up with competition. The technological environment moderates these effects to the degree that possible higher risk from rapid and unpredictable technological change reduces the effect of top management support on AI adoption, while greater technological turbulence increases the effect of normative pressure on a firm’s AI adoption as it tries to keep up with its competitors. Finally, our results suggest that adoption of AI should improve marketing performance.","In this article , the authors explored potential antecedents and consequences of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption as a strategy to deal with this ever-increasing data, and concluded that adoption of AI should improve marketing performance."

A survey of 327 participants was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics to assess AI's role in different decision-making stages. Findings indicate that AI substantially enhances decision efficiency, emotional engagement, and user satisfaction, particularly during the information search and purchase decision phases. Product recommendations emerged as the most influential AI feature, impacting 59% of users’ purchase decisions. Chatbots and dynamic ads also demonstrated significant positive effects, while voice assistants had mixed responses due to limited personalization. The study applies the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and algorithmic trust theory to explain the observed behavior, highlighting that trust and perceived usefulness are central to AI adoption. It also emphasizes emotional alignment as a moderating factor for consumer satisfaction. Despite AI's benefits, concerns around behavioral tracking, data misuse, and algorithmic opacity remain high. These insights suggest that while AI is transforming consumer interaction, its effectiveness depends on emotional design, ethical implementation, and transparent data usage. The study offers practical recommendations for marketers and contributes to emerging theory in human–AI interaction within consumer behavior.","This study examines AI's impact on consumer decision-making in digital marketing, finding AI enhances decision efficiency, emotional engagement, and user satisfaction, particularly through product recommendations, chatbots, and dynamic ads, but raises concerns around data misuse and algorithmic opacity."

Now, it’s not just about showing similar products—it’s helping businesses figure out what people might need or want, even before the customers know it themselves. You can see its impact almost everywhere in e-commerce, and it’s becoming more obvious over time. This paper looks at a bunch of different ways AI is shaping the world of digital commerce. There’s a lot to like—it’s made customer service quicker, helped companies run smoother, and made it easier to spot trends early on. But there’s another side to it, too. Not everything is simple. There are real concerns about how personal data is used, whether AI is always being used ethically, and how tough it can be to actually put AI into systems that were built long before it existed. To understand what’s actually going on, we looked at different kinds of sources—things like academic research, industry reports, and a few visual data sets. What did we find? AI clearly helps e-commerce in a lot of ways. But if companies aren’t thoughtful about how they apply it, or if it doesn’t really fit with their long-term goals, they might not see the full benefit. In some cases, it could even create more issues than it solves.","This paper examines the impact of AI on e-commerce, highlighting its benefits in customer service, trend spotting, and operational efficiency, while also discussing concerns over data usage, ethics, and integration challenges in legacy systems."

Micro influencer is defined as an individual with social media follower count between 1,000 and 100,000 which provide high engagement rate and niche audience trust, making them the choice asset for targeted marketing campaigns. Nevertheless, the flow of frequent customized content for several influencers may bury small to mid-sized agencies and its scope for client expansion. The main aim of this study is to review the ways in which AI-based tools streamline the content creation process and as a result, agencies can boost productivity, content quality and campaign performance, while retaining their human resources. The research takes a mixed methods approach: Qualitative data were collected in the form of case studies of selected micro-influencer marketing agencies that have incorporated AI into their workflows, and quantitative data were drawn from industry reports published recently by platforms like Hootsuite, Sprout Social, Canva, and others that publish performance metrics. Discoveries show how AI considerably cuts down content production time, approximately 30–40%, via automatic generation of captions, choice of hashtags, visual design, and video editing adapted to the influencer personae. In addition, AI-powered analytics platforms assist in identification of audience preferences, content trends, and optimum posting times leading to an additional 25% improvement in such engagement metrics as likes, shares and comments. Content relevance and brand loyalty are further increased through emotional targeting using natural language processing. The research ends with the conclusion that AI is an essential enabler of scalability capability in micro-influencer marketing. Through automation of routine tasks and strategic decision support with data analysis that is real-time, AI unlocks potential to enable agencies to serve a wider range of clients profitably and feature efficiently. The point of the research is also the availability of AI tools, that is, free-to-use (such as AI features of Canva) and paid (such as Sprout Social), making the adoption of AI possible for agencies that have poor financial capabilities.

The research aims to provide insights into the role of AI in enhancing customer segmentation, personalized recommendations, and overall marketing strategies. A quantitative research approach was adopted, utilizing a structured questionnaire distributed through Google Forms. A total of 300 respondents were selected using a convenience sampling technique. Data was analysed and presented using tables, bar charts, pie charts, and donut charts to illustrate key patterns and frequencies. Reliability of the instrument was confirmed through Cronbach’s Alpha, ensuring internal consistency.

However, data privacy concerns were recognized as the most significant barrier, followed by high implementation costs, ethical issues, and a shortage of skilled professionals. Mixed views emerged on AI’s impact on customer trust, although 80% of respondents supported increased investment, highlighting optimism for AI’s role in transforming customer experience in the coming years. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on AI in marketing by combining empirical evidence with practical insights from professionals. It highlights the duality of opportunity and challenge in AI-driven hyper-personalization and underscores the importance of balancing technological innovation with transparency, ethical safeguards, and human oversight.

Despite the growing interest, there remains a significant gap in systematically incorporating AI adoption metrics into B2B marketing frameworks. This proposes a conceptual framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating AI adoption metrics such as model maturity, data readiness, algorithmic transparency, and AI-driven customer insights into B2B marketing decision-making systems. The framework emphasizes a multi-layered approach, wherein AI adoption is not treated as a static investment, but rather as a dynamic capability evolving alongside organizational strategy, technological infrastructure, and market feedback. The proposed model is structured around four core pillars: (1) Organizational Readiness, focusing on leadership alignment, data governance, and talent capabilities; (2) Technological Integration, capturing AI tool deployment, system interoperability, and real-time analytics; (3) Market Responsiveness, addressing customer segmentation accuracy, lead scoring efficiency, and predictive performance; and (4) Ethical and Strategic Alignment, ensuring compliance, transparency, and long-term value creation. Each pillar encompasses specific metrics that allow B2B marketers to monitor, evaluate, and refine AI deployment in decision systems. By embedding these metrics within B2B marketing architectures, firms can enhance decision accuracy, automate routine tasks, and personalize communications at scale, ultimately improving return on marketing investment (ROMI). The framework also provides a foundation for benchmarking AI maturity across firms and industries, enabling continuous improvement and competitive advantage. This review contributes to the intersection of AI and marketing literature by offering a structured pathway for operationalizing AI metrics within strategic decision-making.

India's diverse regional and cultural makeup makes it essential to fully comprehend client preferences. E-commerce behemoths like Amazon India and Flipkart utilize AI-driven algorithms to evaluate consumer data and offer personalized product suggestions that improve user experiences. AI is used by streaming services like Hotstar and Netflix to curate content based on user preferences, boosting engagement and happiness. AI is used by beauty and fashion stores like Nykaa to create virtual cosmetics try-ons that improve the buying experience. Conversational Marketing with AI Chatbots: Companies like Swiggy and Zomato have included AI chatbots into their platforms as a result of the large number of client questions coming from India. Real-time help is provided by these chatbots, which streamlines the ordering process and eases the workload for customer support employees. Brands like HDFC Bank employ chatbots to offer financial advice in addition to client care, assuring 24/7 engagement and fostering brand loyalty. Improved Client Perceptivity with Predictive Analytics: Predictive analytics, which is powered by AI, gives companies the ability to predict customer preferences with a high degree of accuracy. Platforms like Netflix and Flipkart employ AI algorithms to anticipate customer preferences, resulting in personalized discounts and content recommendations. Retailers reduce waste and guarantee that popular items are always accessible by using AI-based demand predictions to optimize inventory management. AI's Impact on material Creation: The use of AI to produce creative material is a growing trend. Marketing professionals may now concentrate on strategic objectives since AI-powered technologies create textual material, create images, and even compose music. In order to save consumers time and show their dedication to providing pertinent and customized information, the Indian travel business Cleartrip employs AI to offer bespoke trip planners. Visual search tools are revolutionizing how customers locate things online, which is especially beneficial given India's unique fashion and design scene. Myntra, a top fashion e-commerce site, uses visual search to enhance the user experience by intuitively suggesting related products based on user-uploaded photographs. Localized marketing techniques are essential in a nation with such a wide range of cultural and linguistic variety, and AI makes it possible.

Compliance with privacy rules, such as the upcoming Personal Data Protection Bill in India, is essential for fostering long-lasting client loyalty and fruitful business collaborations. In the dynamic and fast evolving world of marketing, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more significant.

Companies seek to understand their internal corporate environment and externalities and to exponentially enhance their marketing power. This study aims to understand the influence of Big data analysis on digital marketing. The methodologies used to approach this issue were: (a) a systematic literature review based on articles dated between 2014 and 2020; and (b) a bibliometric analysis of articles dated between 2000 and 2020 using the software VOSviewer. The literature review allowed us to conclude that in the next decades, the business world in general, and marketing in particular, will define more oriented strategies based on a more profound knowledge of consumer behavior. Artificial intelligence agents driven by machine learning methods, technology, and Big data will be a conditioning factor in defining these strategies.","In this paper, a systematic literature review based on articles dated between 2014 and 2020, and a bibliometric analysis of articles dating between 2000 and 2020 using the software VOSviewer were used to understand the influence of Big Data analysis on digital marketing."

The emergence of artificial intelligence technology and machine learning technology leads marketing beyond digital marketing to intelligent digital marketing. In intelligent digital marketing, the company will be able to classify the customers based on their preferences, which ends up having different segmentations for customers. A chatbot is a tool that was discussed in this research to provide customer service to the customers. Chatbots depending on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processors can provide 24/7 services to customers. Other than chatbot benefits to help customers, it will help the company to understand customer needs and to target the required segment of customers for the specific service or product. Chatbot also has some limitations and user resistance which the researcher believes will shrink over time. Digital marketing is a huge industry that impacts both the customer and the company. Focusing on digital marketing with the use of artificial intelligence will create a new way of competitiveness and will create a data market. This paper focused on highlighting both digital marketing and chatbot as artificially intelligent tools to support the customer in digital marketing. The paper covers many facts and theories about this topic.","The use of chatbots as an AI tool in intelligent digital marketing improves customer service, segmentation, and understanding customer needs."

Theoretical Framework: The authors started their research based on technology adoption based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTOUT). This theory was given by Venkatesh et al. (2003). Design/Methodology/Approach: The authors used statistical analysis of technology acceptance and use based on quantitative research data. The authors examine the relationships between experience in “social media marketing” (SMM), knowledge application of “machine learning (ML) in SMM,” and rate of applying “ML algorithms in SMM campaigns,” with potential users’ comprehension of “AI-based software on three pillars (audience analysis, sentiment analysis, and image analysis)” in a sample of one hundred respondents from around the world. Findings: As a result, online marketing may focus more on strategy. A professional in social media marketing may teach a computer using algorithms for machine learning to identify trends in postings that correspond to targeted posts on social networks, hence providing doors for specialized analytical categories. This training can be done on a computer. The results show that prospective users of AI Media software have a high degree of curiosity and trust in its significant proposal. Research Practical and Social Implications: In this digital transformation era, businesses have access to a greater customer of data than ever on their customer’s behaviors. One of the most significant difficulties associated with social media marketing is anticipating people’s interests to provide them with relevant content. Fortunately, machine learning (ML) techniques have been developed that enable natural language replies to online comments. Originality/Value: This study is just the first step in figuring out how the people who will use the AI media software made as part of the Future Web research project plan to use the programmer’s features to their advantage. Due to the quantitative nature of the study and the fact that interviewees came from different countries all over the world at random, the results of the current research should be taken with a grain of salt.","In this article , the authors investigate the implications and impact of artificial intelligence in digital media, focusing on social media marketing, and examine the relationships between experience in social marketing (SMM), knowledge application of machine learning (ML) in SMM, and rate of applying “ML algorithms in SMM campaigns, with potential users' comprehension of AI-based software on three pillars (audience analysis, sentiment analysis, and image analysis)."

How this trend will impact individuals, private and public organizations, and society as a whole is still unknown, and depends largely on how individual consumers choose to adopt and use these technologies. This dissertation focuses on understanding how consumers perceive, adopt, and use technologies that blur the line between human and machine, with two primary goals. First, I build on psychological and philosophical theories of mind perception, anthropomorphism, and dehumanization, and on management research into technology adoption, in order to develop a theoretical understanding of the forces that shape consumer adoption of these technologies. Second, I develop practical marketing interventions that can be used to influence patterns of adoption according to the desired outcome. This dissertation is organized as follows. Essay 1 develops a conceptual framework for understanding what AI is, what it can do, and what are some of the key antecedents and consequences of its’ adoption. The subsequent two Essays test various parts of this framework. Essay 2 explores consumers’ willingness to use algorithms to perform tasks normally done by humans, focusing specifically on how the nature of the task for which algorithms are used and the human-likeness of the algorithm itself impact consumers’ use of the algorithm. Essay 3 focuses on the use of social robots in consumption contexts, specifically addressing the role of robots’ physical and mental human-likeness in shaping consumers’ comfort with and perceived usefulness of such robots. Together, these three Essays offer an empirically supported conceptual structure for marketing researchers and practitioners to understand artificial intelligence and influence the processes through which consumers perceive and adopt it. Artificial intelligence has the potential to create enormous value for consumers, firms, and society, but also poses many profound challenges and risks. A better understanding of how this transformative technology is perceived and used can potentially help to maximize its potential value and minimize its risks.","Castelo as discussed by the authors developed a conceptual framework for understanding what AI is, what it can do, and what are some of the key antecedents and consequences of its' adoption, and tested various parts of this framework."

Since its introduction by Gartner nearly two decades ago, the model has received growing interest from practitioners, and more recently from scholars. Given the model's proclaimed capacity to forecast technological development, an important consideration for organizations in formulating marketing strategies, this paper provides a critical review of the hype cycle model by seeking evidence from Gartner's own technology databases for the manifestation of hype cycles. The results of our empirical work show incongruences connected with the reports of Gartner, which motivates us to consider possible future directions, whereby the notion of hype or hyped dynamics (though not necessarily the hype cycle model itself) can be captured in existing life cycle models through the identification of peak, disappointment, and recovery patterns.","In this article, the authors provide a critical review of the hype cycle model by seeking evidence from Gartner's own technology databases for the manifestation of hype cycles and show that the results of their empirical work show incongruences connected with the reports of Gartners, which motivates them to consider possible future directions, whereby the notion of hype or hyped dynamics can be captured in existing life cycle models through the identification of peak, disappointment and recovery patterns."

First, it recognizes that these tools differ according to how autonomously they can apply their intelligence. On the low end, they simply respond to human queries and instructions; at the (still theoretical) high end, they formulate their own objectives. Second, it reflects the type of tasks smart machines are being used to perform, moving from conventional numerical analysis to performance of digital and physical tasks in the real world. The breadth of inputs and data types in real-world tasks makes them more complex for machines to accomplish. Depending on the type of task a manager is targeting for redesigned performance, this framework reveals the various extents to which it might be performed autonomously and by what kinds of machines. The most capable machine learning systems have the ability to learn their decisions get better with more data, and they remember previously ingested information.

We contend that those developments can generate a tension for marketers, consumers, and policy makers: They can, on the one hand, contribute to consumer well-being by making consumer choices easier, more practical, and more efficient. On the other hand, they can also undermine consumers’ sense of autonomy, the absence of which can be detrimental to consumer well-being. Drawing on diverse perspectives from marketing, economics, philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, we explore how consumers’ sense of autonomy in making choices affects their well-being. We discuss how new technologies may enhance or diminish consumers’ perceptions of being in control of their choices and how either of those can, in turn, enhance of detract from consumer well-being.

Despite successive waves of computerization (including advanced machine learning), jobs have not disappeared. And probably won’t in the near future. To explain why, some basic insights from organization studies can make a contribution. I propose the concept of ‘bounded automation’ to demonstrate how organizational forces mould the application of technology in the employment sector. If work does not vanish in the age of AI, then poorly paid jobs will most certainly proliferate, I argue. Finally, a case is made for the scholarly community to engage with wider social justice concerns.
